# IntroductionToProbabilityPy

Jupyter notebooks with the Python equivalent to the R code sections in Blitzstein and Hwang's [Introduction To Probability, Second Edition](https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-Probability-Second-Edition/Blitzstein-Hwang/p/book/9781138369917)

## Requirements

#### These Jupyter notebooks have been verified on the following Python versions:

* [Python 3.5](https://docs.python.org/3.5/whatsnew/3.5.html)
* [Python 3.6](https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.6.html)
* [Python 3.7](https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html)

The [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) comes highly recommended, as it includes Python, the conda package manager, the Spyder integrated development environment, and a whole universe of Python packages for mathematics and engineering, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Jupyter.

#### Minimum required Python packages:

* [Jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (v1.0.0)
* [NumPy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html) (v1.13.0)
* [SciPy](https://scipy.org/install.html) (v0.19.1)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html) (v2.1.0)
* [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (v7.4.2) ... interactive game for the Monty Hall problem in Chapter 2

#### Other requirements / dependencies

* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (v5.7.0) on the [Google Hosted Libraries content delivery network](https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/#d3js) referenced from the interactive visualization for the Central Limit Theorem in Chapter 10

## Executing these notebooks locally
After installing Python and Jupyter, navigate to this project's home directory where these notebooks are saved, open up a command window or shell interface, and type the following command:

     jupyter notebook

Your default browser will open up to show the Notebook Dashboard at `http://localhost:8888`.

[MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/#gettingstarted) is the JavaScript library Jupyter uses to render ![LaTeX](https://github.com/buruzaemon/IntroductionToProbabilityPy/blob/master/assets/LaTeX.png). To ensure that you have the absolute, latest version of MathJax rendering the math in your locally-executed notebooks, set the `NotebookApp.enable_mathjax` configuration parameter in `jupyter_notebook_config.py` to point to the newest available MathJax.js version on [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/mathjax). (c.f. [Config file and command line options](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config.html), Jupyter docs).

These notebooks have been confirmed to run on:

* Chrome 71.0.3578.98 (official build), 64-bit and Firefox 64.0, 64-bit on Windows 10
* Chrome 69.0.3497.100 (official build, 64-bit and Firefox 52.8.0, 64-bit on Windows 7
* Chrome 71.0.3578.98 (official build), 64-bit; Firefox 64.0 (64-bit); and Safari 12.0.2 (13606.3.4.1.4) on macOS (High Sierra, v10.13.6)
