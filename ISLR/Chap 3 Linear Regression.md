## Simple linear regression

It is a very straightforward simple linear regression approach for predicting a quantitative response Y on the basis of a single predictor variable X. It assumes that there is approximately a linear relationship between X and Y . Mathematically, we can write this linear relationship as:

$$
Y ≈\beta_0 + \beta_1X

$$

You might read “≈” as “is approximately modeled as”. We will sometimes describe (3.1) by saying that we are regressing Y on X (or Y onto X).
